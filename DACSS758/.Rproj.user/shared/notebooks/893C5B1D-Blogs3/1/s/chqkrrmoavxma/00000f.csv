 	 Hey, look yonder, tell me what's that you see Marching to the fields of Concord? Looks like Handsome Johnny with a musket in his hand Marching to the Concord war, hey, marching to the Concord war Hey, look yonder, tell me what's that you see Marching to the fields of Gettysburg? Looks like Handsome Johnny with a flintlock in his hand Marching to the Gettysburg war, hey, marching to the Gettysburg war Hey, it's a long hard road, it's a long hard road It's a long hard road, hey, before we'll be free Hey, look yonder, tell me what you see Marching to the fields of Dunkirk? Looks like Handsome Johnny with a carbine in his hand Marching to the Dunkirk war, hey, marching to the Dunkirk war Hey, look yonder, tell me what you see Marching to the fields of Korea? Looks like Handsome Johnny with an M1 in his hand Marching to the Korean war, hey, marching to the Korean war Hey, it's a long hard road, it's a long hard road It's a long hard road, hey, before we'll be free Hey, before we'll be free Hey, look yonder, tell me what you see Marching to the fields of Vietnam?

Looks like Handsome Johnny with his hand rolled in a fist Marching to the Birmingham war, hey, marching to the Birmingham war Hey, what's the use of singing this song Some of you are not even listening Tell me what it is we've got to do, wait for our fields to start glistening Hey, wait for the bullets to start whistling Hey, here comes a hydrogen bomb and here comes a guided missile Here comes a hydrogen bomb, I can almost hear its whistle I can almost hear its whistle Share lyrics ×"

 	 (UPS) EARTH JULY 1975 Black sails knifing through the pitchblende night Away from the radioactive landmass madness From the silver-suited people searching out Uncontaminated food and shelter on the shores No glowing metal on our ship of wood only Free happy crazy people naked in the universe WE SPEAK EARTH TALK GO RIDE THE MUSIC If you smile at me you know I will understand Cause that is something everybody everywhere does In the same language I can see by your coat my friend that you're from the other side There's just one thing I got to know Can you tell me please who won You must try some of my purple berries I been eating them for six or seven weeks now Haven't got sick once Probably keep us both alive Wooden ships on the water very free and easy Easy you know the way it's supposed to be Silver people on the shoreline leave us be Very free and easy Sail away where the mornin sun goes high Sail away where the wind blows sweet and young birds fly Take a sister by her hand Lead her far from this barren land Horror grips us as we watch you die All we can do is echo your anguished cry and Stare as all you human feelings die We are leaving You don't need us Go and take a sister by her hand Lead her far from this foreign land Somewhere where we might laugh again We are leaving You don't need us Sailing ships on the water very free and easy Easy you know the way it's supposed to be Silver people on the shoreline leave us be Very free And gone NO C'MON GO RIDE THE MUSIC C'MON RIDE IT CHILD Share lyrics ×"

 	 We shall overcome Words and Music by Zilphia Hart., Frank Hamilton, Guy Carawan And Pete Seeger (La melodia sembra sia stata tratta da un canto di pescatori siciliani del 17' Secolo, trasportata in Germania dove è diventata un inno protestante, e da qui Alle congregazioni ""bianche"" protestanti degli Stati Uniti del sud. E' stata Pubblicata per la prima volta come Inno negro in una versione modificata, nei Primi anni dello scorso secolo. Usata, nella forma attuale, negli anni '40 come Inno ""sindacale"" dai lavoratori degli Alimentari e del Tabacco del Sud-Carolina, e successivamente dai lavoratori delle scuole popolari del Tennessee. E' usata tradizionalmente per chiudere tutti I congressi Integrazionisti). We shall overcome, We shall overcome, We shall overcome, some day. Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe We shall overcome, some day. We'll walk hand in hand, We'll walk hand in hand, We'll walk hand in hand, some day. Oh, deep in my heart, We shall live in peace, We shall live in peace, We shall live in peace, some day. Oh, deep in my heart, We shall all be free, We shall all be free, We shall all be free, some day. Oh, deep in my heart, We are not afraid, We are not afraid, We are not afraid, today Oh, deep in my heart, We shall overcome, We shall overcome, We shall overcome, some day. Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe We shall overcome, some day. Share lyrics ×"

 	 Cledus T. Judd/Chris Clark, Cledus Crap Anthems (Sesac)/Of Music, Inc. (Sesac) Twas the fight before Christmas When all through the house No furniture left standing, no tv or couch Our aquarium, heck they even knocked over my Chia Pet Memaw was flung 'cross the room by her hair By her sister Ethel who never fought fair Let's get ready to tumble!!!!!!! The children all wrestled and jumped off the beds Dropping elbows and knees on each other's heads And Mamaw wth her frying pan and Pa with his bat Cleared half the room in ten seconds flat The whole brawl began from an innocent matter When Aunt Flo thought Eugene said ""She looks a whole lot fatter"" She knocked him through the window he fell with a crash Tore down the gutters and busted his leg really bad You ought to have saw it It looked like he'd been in a motorcycle wreck No Kiddin Yeah awful I couldn't turn to look at it You see both sides of our family have never gotten along And every holiday something always go wrong You ain't supposed to fight but spread joy in this season But when they get the nog they just look for a reason In no time at all everybody joined in And right there we squared off with our closest of kin It's a time for givin said Uncle Bill As he gave a black eye to his brother-in-law Phil I heard somebody say ""It's the thought that counts And right now I'm thinking about knocking your butt out"" Presents and fists flew all over the room And Nana had some fancy moves with the broom She took out three cousins and knocked down the tree And I ducked just in time she swung out at me It's my favorite time of year Dad always has too much beer Gets on the roof and hunts reindeer Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily Tie the antlers on the dog Save some shine for Santa Claus From all the in-laws and outlaws Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily I crawled to the phone Lord it seemed like a mile And called 9-1-1 which we keep on speed dial In a matter of minutes out the window appeared Flashing blue lights and the Sherrif John Deere Just then six men burst through the door Some yelling ""HANDS UP"" Some ""GET ON THE FLOOR"" A stray punch from Grandpa found the sherrif's chin And just for good measure he clocked him again It took all 6 cops to get Grandpa in cuffs You know he gets feisty when he runs out of snuff We all stopped our fighting and cheered Grandpa on Heck I thought he could take them I guess I was wrong As they dragged him outside he yelled ""I'VE BEEN FRAMED"" He was kicking and screaming and calling them names ""You (bleep) You (bleep) Let me go you (bleep) You donut eatin stupid (bleep) son of a (bleep)"" We stood on the porch as did all our neighbors Who always took interest in our family's behavior ""Mind your own business"" we heard Grandma shout And ""We'll take back the presents and then come bail you out"" By now we'd forgotten what we were fighting for We were battered and bruised but united once more Then we all joined hands and sang ""Violent Night"" Violent Night And we heard Grandpa exclaim as they drove off out of sight: ""Merry Christmas to all...MAN that was a good fight!!!!"" Deck your neighbor deck the halls Tis the season for a brawl From all of us to all of y'all Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily Share lyrics ×"
