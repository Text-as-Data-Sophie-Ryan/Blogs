 Topic 1: 
 	 Snow cuts loose from the frozen Until it joins with the African sea In moving it changes it's cold and it's name The reason I come and go is the same Animal game for me You call it rain But the human name Doesn't mean shit to a tree If you don't mind heat in your river and Fork tongue talking from me Swim like an eel fantastic snake Take my love when it's free Electric feel with me You call it loud But the human crowd Doesn't mean shit to a tree Change the strings and notes slide Change the bridge and string shift down Shift the notes and bride sings Fire eating people Rising toys of the sun Energy dies without body warm Icicles ruin your gun Water my roots the natural thing Natural spring to the sea Sulphur springs make my body float Like a ship made of logs from a tree Redwoods talk to me Say it plainly The human name Doesn't mean shit to a tree Snow called water going violent Damn the end of the stream Too much cold in one place breaks That's why you might know what I mean Consider how small you are Compared to your scream The human dream Doesn't mean shit to a tree Share lyrics ×"

Tommy: See me. Feel me. Touch me. Heal me. Listening to you, I get the music. Gazing at you, I get the heat. Following you, I climb the mountains. I get excitement at your feet. Right behind you, I see the millions. On you, I see the glory. From you, I get opinions. From you, I get the story. Listening to you, I get the music. Gazing at you, I get the heat. Following you, I climb the mountains. I get excitement at your feet. Right behind you, I see the millions. On you, I see the glory. From you, I get opinions. From you, I get the story. Listening to you, I get the music. Gazing at you, I get the heat. Following you, I climb the mountains. I get excitement at your feet. (Fade:) Right behind you, I see the millions. On you, I see the glory. From you, I get opinions. From you, I get the story. Share lyrics ×"

 	 We shall overcome Words and Music by Zilphia Hart., Frank Hamilton, Guy Carawan And Pete Seeger (La melodia sembra sia stata tratta da un canto di pescatori siciliani del 17' Secolo, trasportata in Germania dove è diventata un inno protestante, e da qui Alle congregazioni ""bianche"" protestanti degli Stati Uniti del sud. E' stata Pubblicata per la prima volta come Inno negro in una versione modificata, nei Primi anni dello scorso secolo. Usata, nella forma attuale, negli anni '40 come Inno ""sindacale"" dai lavoratori degli Alimentari e del Tabacco del Sud-Carolina, e successivamente dai lavoratori delle scuole popolari del Tennessee. E' usata tradizionalmente per chiudere tutti I congressi Integrazionisti). We shall overcome, We shall overcome, We shall overcome, some day. Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe We shall overcome, some day. We'll walk hand in hand, We'll walk hand in hand, We'll walk hand in hand, some day. Oh, deep in my heart, We shall live in peace, We shall live in peace, We shall live in peace, some day. Oh, deep in my heart, We shall all be free, We shall all be free, We shall all be free, some day. Oh, deep in my heart, We are not afraid, We are not afraid, We are not afraid, today Oh, deep in my heart, We shall overcome, We shall overcome, We shall overcome, some day. Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe We shall overcome, some day. Share lyrics ×"

 	 Cledus T. Judd/Chris Clark, Cledus Crap Anthems (Sesac)/Of Music, Inc. (Sesac) Twas the fight before Christmas When all through the house No furniture left standing, no tv or couch Our aquarium, heck they even knocked over my Chia Pet Memaw was flung 'cross the room by her hair By her sister Ethel who never fought fair Let's get ready to tumble!!!!!!! The children all wrestled and jumped off the beds Dropping elbows and knees on each other's heads And Mamaw wth her frying pan and Pa with his bat Cleared half the room in ten seconds flat The whole brawl began from an innocent matter When Aunt Flo thought Eugene said ""She looks a whole lot fatter"" She knocked him through the window he fell with a crash Tore down the gutters and busted his leg really bad You ought to have saw it It looked like he'd been in a motorcycle wreck No Kiddin Yeah awful I couldn't turn to look at it You see both sides of our family have never gotten along And every holiday something always go wrong You ain't supposed to fight but spread joy in this season But when they get the nog they just look for a reason In no time at all everybody joined in And right there we squared off with our closest of kin It's a time for givin said Uncle Bill As he gave a black eye to his brother-in-law Phil I heard somebody say ""It's the thought that counts And right now I'm thinking about knocking your butt out"" Presents and fists flew all over the room And Nana had some fancy moves with the broom She took out three cousins and knocked down the tree And I ducked just in time she swung out at me It's my favorite time of year Dad always has too much beer Gets on the roof and hunts reindeer Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily Tie the antlers on the dog Save some shine for Santa Claus From all the in-laws and outlaws Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily I crawled to the phone Lord it seemed like a mile And called 9-1-1 which we keep on speed dial In a matter of minutes out the window appeared Flashing blue lights and the Sherrif John Deere Just then six men burst through the door Some yelling ""HANDS UP"" Some ""GET ON THE FLOOR"" A stray punch from Grandpa found the sherrif's chin And just for good measure he clocked him again It took all 6 cops to get Grandpa in cuffs You know he gets feisty when he runs out of snuff We all stopped our fighting and cheered Grandpa on Heck I thought he could take them I guess I was wrong As they dragged him outside he yelled ""I'VE BEEN FRAMED"" He was kicking and screaming and calling them names ""You (bleep) You (bleep) Let me go you (bleep) You donut eatin stupid (bleep) son of a (bleep)"" We stood on the porch as did all our neighbors Who always took interest in our family's behavior ""Mind your own business"" we heard Grandma shout And ""We'll take back the presents and then come bail you out"" By now we'd forgotten what we were fighting for We were battered and bruised but united once more Then we all joined hands and sang ""Violent Night"" Violent Night And we heard Grandpa exclaim as they drove off out of sight: ""Merry Christmas to all...MAN that was a good fight!!!!"" Deck your neighbor deck the halls Tis the season for a brawl From all of us to all of y'all Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily Merry Christmas from the whole fam damily Share lyrics ×"
