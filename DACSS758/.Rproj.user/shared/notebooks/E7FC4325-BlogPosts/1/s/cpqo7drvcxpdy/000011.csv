A coed clings to President Nixon's hand as be stands on his car to greet Ohio State University studer
It’s Time to
D Line —
By Carroll Kilpatrick
Washington Post Staff Writer
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Oct. 19
—President Nixon brought his
campaign for a Republican
Congress to Middle America
today with a declaration that
“it is time to draw the line”
against “a rising tide” of ter-
rorism, crime and campus vio-
lence.
Speaking to sizable crowds,
Mr. Nixon drew his biggest ap-
plause when he said, ‘We are
not going to stand for’ vio-
ence and lawlessness and
those who “try to shout down
speakers with obscene words,”
Delivering almost the same
speech in Columbus, Ohio,
Grand Forks, N.D., and in Kan-
sas City, the President cam-
paigned zealously as of old,
urging “the great silent ma-
jority in America to stand up
and be counted.”
He called for the election of
“men in the House and in the
Senate who will vote for strong
laws to deai with law and or-
‘der rather than against them.”
Bearing down heavily on the
issue of lawlessness, Mr. Nixon
told his audiences that yes-
terday he telephoned Cana-,
dian Prime Minister Pierre
Elliott Trudeau to express
“sympathy for what had hap-|
pened” in Quebec.
While he said it would not
be appropriate for him to com-
ment on what happened in
Canada, he nevertheless called
the killing of the Quebec labor
minister “a terrible tragedy.”
Met at almost every stop
by hecklers, some of whom
shouted obscenities or other-
wise tried to shout him down,
the President told North
Dakota voters to remember
that “the four-letter word that
is most powerful of all"" is vote.
Mr. Nixon spoke first on
the Capitol steps in Columbus
in behalf of GOP Senate can-
didate Robert A. Taft Jr., and
GOP gubernatorial candidate
Roger Cloud. —

anti-war
protests
By MICHAEL PRENTICE
WASHINGTON (Reuter). —
AMERICA'S anti-war movement
earned new respect with Satur-
day's peaceful protest by 200,000
opponents of the Vietnam conflict,
and its aims now apparently have
the support of a majority of Amer-
icans.

Organisers rated the-massive pro- |
test as probably the most effective
ever staged here against the war.
It was almost certainly the most
orderly and peaceful of the big
anti-war demonstrations that are
now an annual event in Washing-
ton.

Policemen lining the parade route
had almost nothing to do except
joke and talk with the casually-
dressed crowd, Police Chief Jerry
‘Wilson described the protesters as
“a overy peaceful crowd.”

Although most of the demonstra-
tors were young, public opinion
polis now show most Americans
are wary of the war and favour
setting a date for total withdrawal
of U.S. forces.

President Nixon did not see or
hear the protesters as he was out
of the city for the week-end. But
he has said he will not tip his
hand to the enemy by fixing a date
for an end to U.S. involvement.

Several members of Congress took
part in the demonstration, includ-
ing Indiana Democratic Senator
Vance Hartke, who has a measure
before the Senate calling for an
immediate withdrawal from Viet-
nam. The protest marked the peak
of this year’s anti-war demonstra-
tions here — although others are
still to come, More radical groups
will seek to bring life in the city
to a halt in the first week of May
by civil disobedience.

Saturday’s demonstration, in size
alone, was impressive, with crowds
packing the public grounds in
front of the houses of Congress and
@ sea of people stretching away a
mile along Pennsylvania Avenue
and the Mall.

By police estimates the turnout
of 200,000 was the second largest
ever staged against the Vietnam
War.

The latest protest was dismissed
as ‘a parade of hippies” by right-
wing broadcaster Carl McIntyre, who
heads a movement demanding no-
thing less than a U.S. military vic-
tory in Vietnam.

By JOHN HERBERS

Special to The New York Times
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15—A
vast throng of Americans, pre-
dominantly youthful and con-
stituting the largest mass march
in the nation’s capital, demon-
strated peacefully in the heart
of the city today, demanding a
rapid withdrawal of United
States troops from Vietnam.

The District of Columbia Po-
lice Chief, Jerry Wilson, said a
“moderate” estimate was that
290,000 had paraded on Penn-
sylvania Avenue and had at-
tended an antiwar rally at the
Washington Monument. Other
city officials said aerial photo-
graphs would later show that
the crowd had exceeded 300,000.

Until today, the largest out-
pouring of demonstrators was
the gentle civil rights march of
1963, which attracted 200,000.
Observers of both marches said
the throng that appeared today
was clearly greater than the
outpouring of 1963.

At dusk, after the mass dem-
onstration had ended, a smail
segment of the crowd, members
of radical splinter groups,
moved across Constitution Ave-
nue to the Labor and Justice
Department buildings, where
they burned United States flags,
threw paint bombs and other
missiles and were repelled by
tear gas released by the police.

There were a number of ar-
rests and minor injuries, mostly
the result of the tear gas.

onstrators, who had come from
all parts of the country, were

ing the city. By 11 P.M., the
police said all was quiet in the
city.

About 3,000 youths were un-

able to get to their buses, which
were parked by the Tidal Basin,
because of the tear gas and
heavy traffic, so the city
operated an emergency shuttle
service of sightseeing buses.
' The predominant event of
the day was that of a great and
peaceful army of dissent mov-
ing through the city.

At midday, under clear skies
and in the face of a cold north
wind, a solid moving carpet of
humanity extended from the
foot of the Capitol, 10 long
blocks up Pennsylvania Avenue
to the Treasury Building, four
blocks down 15th Street and
out across the grassy hill on
which the Washington Monu-
ment stands.

The crowds brought to
Washington a sense of urgency
about a Vietnam peace and
impatience with President
Nixon’s policy of gradual with-
drawal. This theme, which was
repeated throughout the day in
various forms, was expressed

WAR RALLY TODAY

‘First-Time’ Protesters May

Make Up for Student Loss
By JOHN DARNTON

Organizers of the New York
contingent in today’s mass anti-
war tally in Washington are
counting upon legions of “first
time” protesters — from the
suburbs, the trade unions, and
from new political groups—~to
offset what they agree is a
noticeable drop in student in:
volvement in war protests.

As last-minute preparations
were being made yesterday,
‘from providing buttons to pro-
curing buses, the groups here
were mobilizing to transport as
many as 100,000 marchers.

This time, judging from those
who have already signed up for
charter transportation, the ranks
will include more older people
and more who are either city
working class or ‘‘establish-
ment” suburban, |

“We used to talk about or
ganizing beyond the student
community, and this time we
were able to do it,” said John.
Mount, 24-year-old former sys-
tems analyst who works for the
New York Peace Action Coali-
tion.

“Eighty per cent of our ticket,
buyers are over 80,” observed
Norma Becker, co-ordinator of
the Vietnam Peace Parade Com-.
mittee. oo

Taking Up the Slack :

Some were dismayed that
students, vanguard of antiwar'
rallies in the last two years,
appeared to be disillusioned,
about the efficacy of mass pro-
test. But others were hopeful|
that the slack would be taken
up in a broadening of the peace
movement,

For example, Local 1199 of
the Drug and Hospital Workers
Union said it had sold 2,500
seats on 50 buses leaving from
the city. Another local chartered
anentire train. Projections from
the Peace Action Coalition are
that at Icast 6,000 union mem-
bers from here will show up.

The coalition, which is han-
dling most of the organized
charters, said 500 buses, five
trains and three airplanes had
been chartered to carry 30,000
protesters from the metropolli-
tan area, They expect 70,000
more New Yorkers to go by
other means,

In contrast to previous years,
2 high proportion of the buses
are coming from small towns
on Long Island and in Connecti-
cut, Westchester County and
northern New Jersey.

Rally to Hear 2 Senators
By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM
Special to The New York Times |
WASHINGTON, Nov. 10—The Nixon Administration |
stepped up its attack on antiwar protesters today, while two
leading Senate critics of the war in Vietnam announced that!
‘they would speak at the mass
rally here Saturday.

Vice President Agnew, in a
speech in Philadelphia, called
the demonstrations a “carnival
in the streets,” performed by a
“strident minority” who raise
“intolerant clamor and cacoph-
ony.”

And ‘transportation Secretary |
John A. Volpe, at a news con-
ference in New York, said that
the demonstrations were being
organized by people who were
“Communist or Communist-in-
spired.”

Senators Charles E. Goodell
and George S. McGovern said
in a joint statement that they
would address the rally at the
Washington Monument. The
demonstration is being coordi-
nated by the New Mobilization
Committee to End the War in
Vietnam.

It was learned tonight from
Governinent sources that the
Government, in a retreat from
its previous position, had
agreed privately to grant the
demonstrators a permit to

march on at least part of Penn-
sylvania Avenue.
Meanwhile, it was reported
that the Defense Department
had alerted troops to cope with
any violence that might de-
velop during the demonstra-
tion.
In a speech to the National
Municipal League, which was
made public here, Mr. Agnew
referred to President Nixon’s
inaugural plea to “lower our
voices” and said:
“I, for one, will not lower
my voice until the restoration
of sanity and civil order allow
a quiet voice to be heard once
again.”
“The mob, the Mobilization,
the Moratorium have become
somewhat fashionable forms of!
citizen expression,” Mr. Agnew
said, adding that they were
“negative in content, disruptive
in effect.”
He called on the “silent
young majority who go to
school and to work and to war,
if necessary,” to “make itself
heard, to come to its own de-
fense.”
Mr. Volpe said a “great many
of these people who support
the demonstrations do so con-
scientiously.” But he declared.
iat majority of the orga-
nizers were “Communist or
Communist-inspired” who did
“nothing but break down our
democracy.”

John D. Rockefeller Cites
Duty of Establishment
By ISRAEL SHENKER

“The main responsibility for
a movement toward reconcilia-
tion and joint action now rests
with the Establishment,” ac-
cording to John D. Rockefeller
3d in a speech he is scheduled
to deliver today at Hampshire
College in Amherst. Mass.

“Young people have been
involved and committed for
some time,’ added the 64-year-.
old philanthropist, who is chair-|
man of the Rockefeller Founda-
tion. “It is our turn now.”

This conclusion was basedi
in part on a recent “Study of
Youth and the Establishment’
by Daniel Yankelovich, Inc.,.
that was prepared for a task|
force on youth and the Estab-
lishment set up by Mr. Rocke-
feller last spring. |

Among the findings of the
National study resulting from
interviews with 872 students’
at 35 universities and colleges
and 408 “business executives
and other Establishment lead-
ers” were the following:

qBy a 3-to-1 margin, college
students would prefer to work
with the Establishment rather
than with protest organizations.

q“The vast majority of all
tollege students” believe that
the system is flexible enough|
to solve problems and over-.
come flaws without radical!

fer reason to violence.

@There is far less backlash
against students among busi-

population,

Other Findings

The study also found that:

GA growing number of stu-
dents hold to a radical diag-
nosis of society, feel increas-
ingly alienated and isolated,
and do not believe that busi-
nessmen will stick with any
project adversely affecting their
business interests. In the last
year, there has been a sharp
increase in the percentage of
Student activists who consider
Businessmen overly concerned
with profits rather than with
social responsibility.

GOnly 16 per cent of he
students believe that the
present two-party svstem offers
real alternatives. The students|
have growing doubts that Amer-
ican democracy can respond
effectively to the needs of the
people.

@Students are _ increasinsly
opposed “to fighting any war
designed to contain Commu-
nists, maintain our position of
power in the world or fight
for our honor.”

@A majority of students be-
lieve that Black Panthers, radi-
cals and hippies cannot be as-
sured of a fair trial in this
country. Many students add
college protesters, conscientious
objectors, antiwar leaders and
drug addicts to this list.

@During the last year, such
activist tactics as blockades,
resisting or assaulting the
police, or holding authorities as
captives have gained further
acceptance among _— students
whom the study calls “fore-
runners,” i.e., those not con-
cerned only with careers.

In an interview last week at
his 56th-floor office at 30
Rockefeller Center, Mr. Rocke-
feller was determined not to
speak of specific problems but
rather to emphasize opportuni-
ties for cooperation.

“My very simple thesis is
that society faces overwhelm-
ing problems and we’re not do-
ing as effective a job as we
could to meet them,” he said.

“At the same time,” he con-
tinued, “‘we have young people
who are our future, who are
our leaders of tomorrow, con-
cerned about the problems.
They want to be involved, to
be relevant to the problems of
our time, to have a part in
decision-making.” He added:

“We of the older generation
need their fresh ideas, their
feeling for change, and I think
it’s right for older people to be|
pushed to re-think, both per-
sonally and institutionally. |
